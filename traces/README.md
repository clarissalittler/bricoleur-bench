# Purpose
This directory is for building out (synthetic) traces of hypothetical student work from start to finish of a program.

It should have subdirectories for the different problems and each of those directories should in turn have subdirectories containing the traces for the student types.

In this directory there are two lists that should be maintained:

1. student-types.md
2. problem-list.md

These traces should represent a coherent sequence of potential edits, missteps, and in-progress programs in terms of meeting the goal.

We want to reflect an editing sequence that is coherent for the student type and reflects actual changes to a single program in service of getting it to a goal, mistakes and missteps and refactors all included.

The student types should reflect a spectrum from "bricoleur" to "planner", using different kinds of tinkering and planning and levels of abstraction vs. concrete thinking.
